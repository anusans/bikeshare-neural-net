# Bike Neural Net

## Overview
I wrote this neural network from scratch using Pandas and Numpy. The nueral network predicts the number of bike users in a time period. To train the neural network, I used bike sharing data from the University of Porto.

## Requirements
* Python 3 environment (`pyenv` recommended)

## Usage
1. Run `pip install requirements.txt` to install all packages.
1. Open `Bike Neural Network.ipy` in Jupyter Notebook or equivalent and execute the cells to train and run the neural net.
